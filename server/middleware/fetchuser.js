// Express is a routing and middleware web framework that has minimal functionality of its own:
//  An Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls.

// Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware 
// function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.
